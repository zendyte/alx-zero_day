# Welcome to my second readme file

Welcome to **my 0x03-git** repo created for **ALX SE Training**. This repository will be used as a library for all my code base through this program.

Always checkout the README.md file for guidance if you're lost...

Once again welcome, and smooth sail.
**Disclaimer:** this article is copied from my previous GIT project 0x01-git!
